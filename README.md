# 🎵 TuneStacker

**TuneStacker** is a sleek, revamped music app for Android built with Java and designed for performance, simplicity, and style.  
This is the **v2.0 rebuild** of the original [TuneStacker project](https://github.com/ErikNguyen20/TuneStacker), rewritten from the ground up to be faster, cleaner, and more modern.

One of its standout features? 🎬 **It can download and play audio from YouTube links** using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), the powerful command-line video downloader.
